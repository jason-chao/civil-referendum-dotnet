# 2014 Macau Civil Referendum

The source code of the software system developed for the 2014 Civil Referendum on Chief Executive Election in Macau is published here for archival purpose.    In the case which a vote anticipates authorities' interference, new techniques should be adopted to anonymise and protect voters' data.  The use of the same design and architecture in future votes is strongly discouraged.

Apologies for the code not being well-commented.   The time constraint on development did not allow for proper documentation.
